FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION.

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of
my colleagues. I got your information from a personal search in the
internet business index. I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operationwith you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of
all
parties, and hopeyou will keep it confidential because of the nature of
this business.
Within the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources where I work
as a Director of Project Implementation, and with co-operation
of four other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue
payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage
of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a
foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced
to the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost
has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance
unclaimed.

Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign
contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations
with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies.
As a result we included ours bills for approvals with the co-operation
of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve
Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance as
the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed
to operate a foreign account.

I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that,
should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share
as compensation will be 25% while my colleagues and I receive 70%, and
the balance of 5% for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.
It does not matter whether or not your company does contract
projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that
your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other
companies. More often than not, big trading companies and firms
of unrelated fields wins major contracts and subcontract to more
specialized firms for execution.

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my
 e-mail address above,to indicate whether or not you are interested in this
deal. If
you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner
to carry out this deal.I want to assure you that my partners
and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim
possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secured.It is important that
you treat this matter with utmost confidentiality as any form
of exposure will negatively affect us since we are still in active
Government Service.

Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this transaction.I have reposed my confidence in
you and hope that you will not disappoint us.

Kindly notify me for further details, upon your acceptance
of this proposal.

Regards,

Engr.Makalele Johnson

Dear Sir,

I am Mr.Tambo, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or
my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. Tambo

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE.

Grace, Peace And Love From This Part Of Atlantic To
You

I must sincerely solicit your strictest confidence in
this transaction, this is by virtue of it's nature as
being utterly confidential and top secret. What I
am about to divulge to you in this mail is top
secret and if it offends or does not meet with your
business ethics, I crave your indulgence.

 I am George Ineh a member of a special committee
set up by the present civilian Government of
Nigeria. We are saddled with the task of auditing the
Accounts of government parastatals and ministries for
the last ten years.

In the course of our work at the committee, we discovered
this fund which resulted from gross re-valuation of
contracts by top government officials of the last
Administration. The companies that executed the
Contracts have been duly paid and the contracts
Commissioned leaving the sum of US$15.6 Million
floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of
Nigeria ready for payment.

I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by
my colleagues in the committee to look for an overseas
partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$15.6M
Legally subcontracting the entitlement to you/your
company. This is bearing in mind that our civil
service code of conduct forbids us from owning
foreign company or running foreign account while in
government service hence the need for an overseas
partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared after it
has been paid into your nominated account based on
each parties negotiation upon your acceptance and
willingness to assist us in this transaction. We have
also agreed that our own share of the fund will be
used for importation business in conjunction with you
as we can not bring back cash to Nigeria.

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked
out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction
within ten to fourteen days of commencement after
receipt of the following information: Your full
name/ company name, address, company's details &
activities, telephone & fax numbers.

These information will enable us make the applications
and lodge claims to the concerned ministries &
agencies in favor of your company and it is pertinent
to state here that this transaction is entirely based
on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque
drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria
correspondent bankers in America, Asia and Europe is
going to be made in your name. In order to move forward
quickly, please respond to me by Tel:234 17767344,
American Internet Fax:1775-307-0634
(This number was acquired for confidentiality) so I can
 bring you into the complete picture of this pending
project and provide more information as to the successful conclusion of
this project. The best response, however, would be by telephone,
so we can discuss fully all issues
needed to complete this venture in good time, and
successfully.

I await your prompt and positive response to this
business proposal thank you and God bless.

Yours Faithfully,

DR George Ineh.

ATTN:
            URGENT ASSISTANCE NEEDED
You may be surprise to receive this Email from me since you do not know me
personally.
However, I would like to introduce myself. I am Michael Stevens Junior, the
son of Doctor. Simon Stevens. Who was murdered few months ago in Zimbabwe,
as a result of land dispute? Before the death of my father (Dr. Stevens), he
had taken me to Amsterdam and deposit the sum of Fifteen Million United
States dollars (US$15,000,000) in a security company, as he foresaw the
looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money in question was deposited in a box as
Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company. The proposed
amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the
farms and establishment of new farms on Swaziland. As you may be aware this
land problem came into force when Zimbabwe president Mr. Robert Mugabe
Introduced the Land Reformed Act of which my father rich farmers and some
black farmers where affected. This resulted to the killing and Mob action by
Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society, a lot of people were
killed because of this Land reformed act of which my dad was one of the
victims. It is against this background that my family and Iaugustim who are
currently staying in Amsterdam decided to transfer my father's money to a
foreign account. Since the Dutch law prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to
open any account or be involved in any financial transaction. As
The eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking
a genuine foreign account where the money could be transferred. I am faced
with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in Holland for the fear
of going through the same experience in future since both countries have
similar history. Moreover, The Netherlands foreign exchange policy does not
allow such investment from asylum seekers. I humbly solicit for your
assistance in the following:
1) Pay a short working day visit to Amsterdam the Netherlands so that we see
face to face, Have a table talk that would create confidence in me that the
funds will be safe in your hands and have an agreement from an advocate,
which will be duly and legally sign in his chambers before taken any step in
this transaction.
2) Get the entire necessary document regarding this transaction and claim
the boxes from the security company, open an account in your name with a
local bank here and deposit the money for onward transfer to your designated
account in overseas.
3) Make a good arrangement for investment and do invest the money for me, I
am willing to give you some percentage for your assistance on this, and I
offer you 15%. 5% for any expenses, including your telephone calls and any
other expenses that may arise during this process. 80% would be invested and
you get your wages monthly for managing the funds. Contact me on the above
Email, provide me with your telephone and fax number so we can discuss
further and a chance for you to ask me any question you may have in mind,
while you maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction.
Please kindly get back to me with your detail contacts.
Sincere Regards,
Michael Stevens Junior.

Dear Friend,
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is
necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I will crave your
indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR Ademola Williams
of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory,
may his soul rest in peace.
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my
country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the
rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one
of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We
immediately decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in
Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being
threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi
Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other
Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila.In
view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist
us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a
security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the
Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through
normal custom/airport screening and clearance.friends (western countries) who
suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President
Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor
met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in
your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance,
this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge
success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires
a total confidentiality.Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your
telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost
indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your

Dear Sir,

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform  you that
this letter is not a hoax mail and
I urge you to treat it serious. We want to  transfer
to overseas account ($35,000.000.00 USD) (Thirty Five
Million United States Dollars)  from a Standard Trust
Bank Ltd here in Nigeria, I want to ask you, If you
are not capable to  quietly look for a reliable and
honest person who  will be capable and fit to provide
either an  existing bank account or to set up a new
Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an
empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long  as
you will remain honest to me till the end for  this
important business trusting in you and  elieving in
God that you will never let me down either now or in
future.

I am Dr. Muhammad Khalil Hasan, the Auditor General
of Standard Trust Bank Ltd here in Nigeria.  During
the course of our auditing, I discovered a floating
fund in an account opened in the bank in 1996 and
since 1998 nobody has operated on this account
again,after going through some old files in the
records I discovered that the owner of the account
died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating
and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will
be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account
is Mr. Robert Chapman a Canadia and great
industrialist.  He was African Area Director of SIL
International, who unfortunately died in the plane
crash of Kenya Airways Flight 431 in Abidjan, Ivory
Coast, January 30 2000.  You will read more stories
about the crash on  visiting this website,
news.airwise.com/airlines/archive/2 000/kenya2000.html
and also in this website,
www.sil.org/sil/news/2000/chapman.html  where
Chapman's company talked about his death in
the Kenya crash. You shall as well find the pictures
of Chapman and his wife there.

No other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that until
his death he has a Gold/Diamond Consulting firm.I also
found out that their only surviving daughter died last
year.

The total amount involve is ($35,000.000.00 USD)
(Thirty Five Million United States Dollars) and we
wish to transfer this money into a safe foreigners
account abroad. But I don't know any foreigner,
I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this
money can not be approved to a local person here, but
to a foreigner who has information about the account,
which I shall give to you upon your positive response.
I am revealing this to you with believe in God that
you will never let me down in this business, you are
the first and the only person that I am contacting for
this business, so please reply urgently so that I will
inform you the next step to take urgently.

I need your strong assurance that you will never let
us down, me and a key bank official who is deeply
involved with me in this business.  I guarantee  that
this transaction will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of
the law.  The bank official Will destroy
all documents of transaction immediately we receive
this money leaving no trace to any place.  I will use
my position and influence to obtain all legal
approvals for onward transfer of this money to your
account with appropriate clearance from the relevant
ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
40% of the total amount, 60% will be for us, I look
forward to your earliest reply.

PLEASE, TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET.

Find in the attachment my Family Picture, to proof
who I am.

Best Regards

Dr. Muhammad Khalil Hasan.

Dear Sir,

Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing the sum of USD22,000.000 (twenty two million dollars)inherited from my father's business reserve.

I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family.my father was an agriculturist. He became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was victimized by President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was assassinated by unknown gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding the minority white farmers. Before his death, my father foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and property and decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property of our family since our home was burnt and the farmlands and machines seized;yet the government and it's loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us.

To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 25% of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or 35% share for possible help on investing in any reliable venture.

if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed information. if you do not accept my offer, in good fate treat with utmost confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers for more confidential communication will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

DANDLA NGUBE

Dear Sir,

I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance

to
 each other likewise developing a cordial business relationship. As I am
 interested in your kind of business and wishing to invest in your country.



I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha, wife to the late Nigerian military Head of State.
 General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 still in office due
to

a
 protracted illness.

I believe you must be aware of the recent face-off between my family and the


 present Civilian Government of President Olusegun Obasanjo who wants all my


 Late husbands foreign bank accounts and assets confiscated because of the
 monetary excesses of my la


te husbands
Military regime.

Currently, within my reach is the sum of twenty-three Million seven Hundred


 thousand United States Dollars (US$ 23,700,000.00) cash, which I intend to

use
 for investment purposes especially in your country. This huge sum of money


 came
 as result of a pay


back contract
deal between my late husband and a Russian firm on our country's Multi
billion


 Dollar Ajaokuta Steel plant/complex. The Russian partners had since
returned


 my
 husband's share of US$23.7Million after his death and lodged it with a
 security
 firm.

Right now the new Civilian Government have revoked all our licenses that
allows


 us to own financial and oil companies and has frozen some of my late
husbands


 bank account in Switzerland and America.

In view of these I acted very fast to withdraw this US$23.7M from the
security


 company's vault well preserved and packaged in {1}trunk box and lodged in a


 private security firm OVERSEAS as Family Deposits (FD) No record ever
existed


 concerning the money


neither is the money traceable by the Government because there is no
documents


 showing that we received the money from the Russians.

However, due to the current situation in the country concerning the present


 civilian Government hostile attitude towards my family, it has become quite


 impossible for me to make use of the money within the country. Thus I seek


 your
 assistance in moving t


his family Deposits (FD) into your account for safekeeping pending my
arrival


 in
 your country for investment purposes.

On your consent, I shall provide you with a POWER OF ATTORNEY to collect
this


 deposit with the security company OVERSEAS on our behalf. Bearing in mind
that


 your assistance is needed in this regards, I propose a commission of 20%
 (TWENTY PERCENT) of the


total sum to you for the expected services and 10% for local and
international expenses if any.

Your urgent response is highly needed so as to start further contact .
I therefore mandate Barrister GREG ADO who is our family Attorney to deal

 with
 you through out this transaction on my behalf.

May I at this point, emphasize the high level of confidentiality which this


 business demands whatever your decision and hope you will not betray the
trust


 and confidence which I repose in you.

Please don't forget to indicate your convenient phone and fax number where
we


 can always contact you.

However, you may need to give me sufficient assurance that you will not sit

on
 this fund when it is finally remitted into your account. Please direct your


 reply of this mail to my family attorney,GREG ADO at gregado@rxpost.net and

discuss with


him towards effective completion of this transaction.

I believe I can trust you and I am willing to accept from you any useful and


 profitable investment proposal advice in your country. or reply me if my
 proposal interest you through my alternative email address:
mcabacha@gawab.com


s.

Remain blessed.

Best wishes,
Mrs. Maryam Abacha.

Dear Sir/madam,

 It is with trust and believe that I write to you. I am
 BarristerEDWARD SMITH, a Solicitor at Law. I am the
 personal attorney to  william cole a National of
 your Country, who used to work with Shell Development
 Company here in Nigeria

 On the 21st of April 2001, my client, his wife and
 their only daughter were involved in a car accident
 along apongbon express road ogun state. All occupants of
 the vehicle unfortunately lost there lives. Since then
 I have made several enquiries to locate any of my
 clients extended relatives, this hasalso proved
 unsuccessful.

 After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided
 to track his last name over the Internet, to locate
 any member of his family hence I contacted you. I have
 contacted you to assist in recovering the fund valued
 at US$15.4 Million left behind by my client before it
 gets confisicated or declared unserviceable by the
 Security Finance Firm where this huge amount were
 deposited.

 The said Security Finance Company has issued me a
 notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the account
 confisicated within the next twenty one official
 working days. Since I have been unsuccesfull in
 locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek
 the consent to present you as the Next of Kin to the
 deceased since you bear his last names, so that the
 proceeds of this account can be paid to you.

 Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we
 shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities
 for transfer. I have all necessary information and
 legal documents needed to back you up for claim. All I
 require from you is your honest cooperation to enable
 us see this transaction through. I guarantee you that
 this will be executed under legitimate arrangement
 that will protect you from any breach of the law.

 an early reply.

Attn:My dear friend

I am Dr Mike Odey, the Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos=20
Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for=20
you.

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian=20
National=20
Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed)=20
Deposit=20
for=20
twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00(Twenty- five Million=20
Dollars) in my branch. =20

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address=20
but got=20
no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered=20
from=20
his=20
contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that=20
Mr. Barry=20
Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I=20
found out=20
that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next=20
of kin=20
to date has fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry=20
Kelly did=20
not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,=20
including his=20
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is=20
still=20
sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the=20
principal=20
sum=20
at the end of each year. =20

No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,=20
at the=20
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of=20
the=20
Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently,=20
my=20
proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the=20
next of=20
kin=20
to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man=92s labor will not=20
get=20
into=20
the hands of some corrupt government  officials. =20

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names,=20
address, telephone and fax numers so that the Attorney will prepare the=20
necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the=20
next of=20
kin. We shall employ the service of another Attorney for drafting and=20
notarization=20
of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of=20
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will=20
then=20
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of=20
kin. =20
The money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in=20
the=20
ratio=20
of 60% for me, 35% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on=20
either=20
sides during the course of this transaction.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will=20
be done=20
by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the=20
successful=20
execution of this transaction. Upon your=20
response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant=20
documents=20
that will help you understand the transaction better.=20

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this=20
transaction=20
would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your=20
assistance=20
to invest my share in your country. Looking forward to hearing from you=20
soonest.

Best regards,

Dr Mike Odey.

Office of the chairman
Contract awarding committe
Ecowas headquarters
Lome,Republic of togo.

Attn:

Account provision for usd 9.5m

Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you
asa surprise and if it might offend you without your
prior consent and writing through this channel.

I am George Ugo,The Chairman, Contract
Awardind Committee of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST
AFRICAN STATES ( ECOWAS)with Headquarters in Lome,
Togo.I got your information in a business directory
from the Togolaise Chamber of Commerce and Industries
when I was searching for a reliable,honest and
trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I was
simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact
from the many names and lists in the directory.

After discussing my view and your profile with my
colleagues,they were very much satisfied and deci! ded
to contact you immediately for this mutual business
relationship.We wish to transfer the sum of
USD9.5,000,000.00 (Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars only.)into your personal or
company`s bank account.

This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract
bills awarded by us for the supply of ammunitions,
hard/soft wares,phamaceauticals/medical items,light
and heavy duty vehicles, apperals and other
administrative logistics etc for the ECOMOG in
Sierria-Leone and Liberia during the Peace Keeping
Projects.

This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully
protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed
off.As the Chairman of CAC,I have the cooperation and
mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of
the Organisation.We arranged and over invoiced the
contract funds supplied by different companies from
different countries during the crisis.

It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a
willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to
transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne
out of our beleif in the non-stable and sporous
political nature of this sub-region.

The original contractors have been duely paid by the
Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest
(Central Bank of the West African States)through our
bankers-Societe Generale Banque.This balance is
suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by
any foreign company of our choice.We intend to pay out
this fund NOW as the organisation is winding up its
activities since the aim of returning PEACE to the
countries and the coast has been achieved.

Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil
servants working under this organisation, are not
allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more
reason why we needed your assistance to provide an
account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping
and our future investment with your comprehensiv! e
advise,assistance and partnership in your country.

It is however agreed,as the account owner in this deal
to allow you 30% of the entire sum as compensation,65%
will be held on trust for us while 5% will be used to
defray any incidental charges and cost during the
course of the transaction.

This transaction will be successfully concluded within
14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due
cooperation.You should provide the followings;

YOUR COMPANY`S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,TEL
AND FAX NUMBERS.(if available)

THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL,FAX
AND TELEX NUMBERS.

THE ACCOUNT NUMBER

THE COMPLETE MAILING ADRRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY
WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.

Upon the receipt of this informations,the documents
and approval with the texts will be sent to you for
confirmaton and then forwarded to the organisation for
ratification and subsequent payment.

As with the case of all organised (s! ensitive)and
conspired DEALS,we solicit for your unreserved
confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We
hope to retire peacefully and lead a honourable
business life afterwards.There are no risks involved.

Reply Asap.
With Regards.

Austin Dunger.

Attention: Friend,

I am Barrister Vincent Usman a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Mr.
John Anderson a foreigner, who was a contractor to Shell Petroleum
Development Company in Nigeria(SPDC). On the 26th of September 1992, my
client, his wife and their three children were involved in a Plane crash on
their way to Yankari Games Reserve for 2week`s holiday.

Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the plane crash, Since then I
have made several enquiries to his Embassy and the home address he filled
in his file in my office to locate any of his extended relatives, this has
also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I
decided to use the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no
avail, hence I contacted you.

I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left
behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable
by the SECURITY & FINANCE HOUSE where this fund is deposited. Particularly,
the FINANCE HOUSE where the deceased had an account valued at about US$9M
(Nine million dollars). Conseqently, the bank issued me a notice to provide
the next of kin or have the account confiscated.

since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 10 years
now. I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased
since you are a foreigner so that the proceeds of this account valued at
US$9M can be paid to you and I. We shall share the money thus 55% to me and
40% to you, while 5% will be used to re-imburse any expenses that might be
incurred on both ends and to service the tax that might incur be in your
country.

I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any
claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us
seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

Yours Faithfully,

Barrister Vincent Usman(Esq).

N.B. Please indicate your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication
in this mutual transaction.

Dear Sir



It's my pleasure to send you this mail which I hope you will treat as highly
confidential. I am Mr.JERRY PETER ,A 53 years old man and the Deputy
Treasury
Officer with the Central Bank of Nigeria lagos.During the Military regime
of Late General Sani Abacha, contracts runing into several millions of
dollars
were awarded to friends and cronies fronting for the late despotic ruler,but
unfortunately before such payments could go
through, he died mysteriously in power.

I am writing you for assistance in transfering the sum of US$36.8 million
dollars into your account.This amount represents just a payment due to one
of his friends for a contract awarded to him but was not actually
executed,he is afraid to come forward to claim the money for fear of being
prosecuted.

This money is lying dormant in the vaults of the Central Bank of Nigeria
and I use this opportunity to crave your indulgience in transfering this
money intoyour account, this business is totally risk free,it is only
myself that is aware of this floating money.For your assistance,I am
willing to give you 30% of the total sum,while you will assist me in
investing my share in viable businesses in your country pending when I
eventually resign my appointment and join you.Please if you know you can
assist me,endeavour to get in touch with me as soon as possible so i can
give you the necessary details so as to conclude the transfer within 7
working
days.

Dear sir,

I am pleased to introduce a business opportunity to you,to transfer to your
overseas account,sum of,(US$10.500.000m)Ten million five hundred thousands
United States Dollars) from one of the Prime Banks here in Dakar-Senegal,I
urgently want to know soonest you,If you are not capable to handle and
acomodate this magnitude of funds untill i resign and come over to join for
an investment in your country,tell me so that i can quietly look for another
reliable and honest individual/organisation that would be capable and fit
enough to provide either an existing bank account
or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this funds,even an empty
a/c can serve to receive
this funds,as long as you will remain honest to me till we actualise this
interest,believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr Mona Noah the Auditor General of one of the prime banks here in
Dakar Senegal west Africa during the course of our auditing,I discovered a
floating fund in an account opened in the our bank
since 1982 and till date no body has operated on this account again,after
going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of
the account died long ago in a plane crash along with his
family without leaving a[Heir/WILL] hence the funds is floating and if I do
not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.The owner
of this account is Khalifa T.Ibrahim a foreigner
before his death,he was a management consultant and he died since 1992.No
other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the
account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that until his sudden death he was a management consultant.

Since I hardly know any foreigner,I am only contacting you as a foreigner
partner to stand and apply as his next of kin because this money can not be
approved to a local person here as his next of kin,without valid
international foreign passport,but can only be approved to any foreigner
with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because
the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the a/c is a foreigner
too,and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management
is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct
information of this account,which I will give to you upon your positive
response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with
instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this
business.I need your strong assurance that
you will never,never let me down.

With my influence and my position in the bank the bank official can transfer
this money to any foreigner's reliable account that you can provide with
assurance that this money will be intact pending on my physical arrival in
your country for sharing. The bank official Will destroy all documents of
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence you
can call me for heart to heart discussion through my private satellite phone
which I secured for the security and safety of this business as you know
that this business is confidential.

At the conclusion of this business,you will be given 35% of the total
amount,60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might
have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email address.
you can contact me with:   mnoah12@hotmail.com
Yours truly,

Mr Mona Noah.

Dear Sir.

 May I seek your indulgence to introduce my humble
 self. I am Kokor Mobutu, the son of the late Zaire
 Republic President, Mobutu Sese Seko.
 Before the death of my father, he kept in my custody
 the sum of USD 30 Million ( Thirty million United
 States Dollars ) this money emanated from the sales
 of
 diamonds he made when he was still on the throne.

 My father lodged this money in a security company
 outside our country for security reasons and because
 of the political instability in my country.


 My Father introduced me to the security company       shortly before
 his death. He however deposited this money without
 any
 name rather, with coded numbers which is in my
 possession. With my father dead, my life was at
 great
 risk, I therefore had to leave my country under
 cover
 to
 Spain.

 Now, I have decided to invest this money in a
 suitable
 and conducive environment. At this point, I now seek
 your assistance to transfer this money to your bank
 account for proper use. 20% of the total money will
 be
 yours after the transfer and 5% for any expenditure
 we
 might incur in the process while the balance will be
 for me.

 On the receipt of your positive response to assist
 me
 on this project, all information related to the
 project will be made available to you on request.
 This
 business is 100% risk free as long as the
 confidentiality the business needs is observed. For
 this business to take off, your bank particulars
 where
 this fund will be paid into is required.

 You can always reach me on my

 E Mail address,kokormobutu@yahoo.co.uk

 or telephone number-00 346 099 146 24

 Warm Regards,
  Kokor

Attention:

With warm hearts I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope
This letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to
Receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.
and due to the rate of scam mails being sent around the world you
might find it difficult to trust anyone,but please do not regrad this mail as =
such as i have all genuine documentsand facts backing my claims,and also a =
reputable security and financial institution in europe is were my funds is =
deposited.

However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this =
transaction(TRANSFER), which I propose with my free mind and as a person of =
integrity.

My name is HAROLD.A.MBEKI, the son of LATE STEVE ZHIRI MBEKI,
One of the most popular farmers from Zimbabwe, who was murdered in the
Land dispute in my country.As led by my instinct, I decided to contact you =
through email, after searching for Contacts via the internet, as it is the =
only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe =
for now. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.

The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a
Business venture i intend to go into as soon as i get out this funds.

Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, and President Robert =
Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white =
farmers and the few rich black farmers,all white farmers were asked to =
surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infact to his =
political party members and my father though black was the treasury of the =
farmers  association and a strong Member of an opposition party that did not =
support the president's idea.

He then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to
Invade my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. They Killed my =
father and took away a lot of items from his farm.

After the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my
Father Reverened Theophilus Nnamni ,handed us over will documents with =
instructions from my father That we should leave Zimbabwe incase anything =
happen to him.

The will documents have a certificate of deposit, Airway bill confirming cash =
Deposit totalling Twelve million five hundred thousand united state
dollars. [$12.5m] kept in custody for us in a security company unknown to
the company (BRITISH INVESTMENT TRUST SECURITY COMPANY (NETHERLANDS)
that the content is money hence it was deposited as PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

This money was deposited with this Private Security Company for
Safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase
Of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in
Botswana.

This violent and barbaric act by Mugabe has since led to the death of
My beloved mother and kid sister and other innocent lives.I was continually =
threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father
After he was murdered. I resisted for a while, but when the danger
Became unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe
With the help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from
Australia also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left
With his family following this ugly development I have tried to reach
Him but all to no avail.

I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political
Asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because
the security company from South Africa, has a branch here, I have
Contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in
Johannesburg to The affiliate office here in Amsterdam The Netherlands
which they have finally confirmed to me that the funds has sucessfully
being transfered to their branch office in AMSTERDAM NETHERLANDS.
and that they are waiting further directives from me before they effect the =
transfer tomy nominated bank account.but due to my refugee status its being =
difficult for me moving this Money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a =
refugee (asylum Seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any =
financial Transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable =
Partner and friend, whose account this money can be transferred after the =
consignment,hence your involvement in this venture.and that would be with the =
assistance of Advocate Smith.E.Fevinn
who has his chambers in DEN HAGG,in the NETHERLANDS who has agreed to stand =
by me till my funds is released, after hearing all my ordeal and verifying my =
claims from the security company.

You have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big
And brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of
the safe keeping of this money.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist
With arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from
their office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transferred
>From Johannesburg, South Africa to their branch here. The company will
be legally informed of you representing me.

For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can
Choose to have 20% of the money for your assistance, and helping me
Open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into
Partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money
in your country.Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in
Your reply.

I have also set aside 1 % of the total sum $12.5M for all kinds of
Expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
For Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 20% for
Your moral and financial assistance then the balance will be left
in the account here for me.

Please note that this 1% is not with me at the moment but shall be
deducted from The total contract sum as soon as the money finally hits your =
nominated account.because it is from this i% that i have to settle the =
barrister.

Finally I want you to maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of
This transaction.as i do not want anything that would jeopardise this
transfer,all my life soley depend on this funds to start up a better life as =
i have no one else to fall back to.as i have lost all i have gotten back =

Asalam alekum,
I salute you in the name of most High Allah. I am Mrs. Maryam
Abacha, the widow of the late Gen. Sani Abacha former military
Head of State who died mysteriously as a result of cardiac
arrest. Since my husband's death, my family has been under
restriction of movement and that notwithstanding, we are being
molested and constantly under watch by the seemingly agent, above
all, our banks account here and abroad have been frozen by the
Nigerian civilian government. Furthermore, my eldest son is in
detention by the Nigerian Government for more interrogation about
my husband's asset and some vital documents.
Following the recent discovery of my husband's bank account by
the Nigerian government with my son's bank in which a huge sum of
US$700 million and 450 million Dutch Mark was lodged and 6
billion dollars belonging to my late husband was seized by the
government of Nigeria. I therefore wish to personally appeal to
you seriously and religiously for your urgent assistance to
transfer the sum of $25.5 million United States Dollars into your
account in your country which has already been lodged in a Global
crossing Diplomatic ?security? in abroad by my Late Husband and I
have
a prove of the Certificate of Deposit with the telephone and fax
number of the ?security? company in abroad, the name of the head of
operation including the telephone and fax number of the agency
whom help in packaging the consignment. since we can not leave
the country due to the restriction of movement imposed on the
members of my family by the Nigerian Government and my
International pass
port impounded at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport,
Lagos in August 1998 and presently the consignment is incurring
more demurrage and if the government discovered they might seize
the fund (consignment) that was the reason I was advise by our
Family lawyer for the safety of the fund, to look for an honest
and reliable foreigner who is willing to be of assistant to
enable the fund to be transfer to his account while you are
entitled to 25% of the fund while 5% is for any expenses which
might include your phone calls , stationary which must be
deducted before sharing.
Also, if you accept this proposal, I shall give you the telephone
and fax number of the ?security? company in abroad where the
consignment
is lodge including agency for verification and you shall as well
forward your data including your telephone and fax number to our
Family Lawyer who shall help in the legal documentation to make
you the legal owner of the fund by a prove of an affidavit from
the Federal High Court for a change of fund ownership by me which
my lawyer shall forward with an application to the Court to
enable the court to issue an legal clearance certificate as a
prove that the fund is no longer belong to ABACHA FAMILY but you
as the new beneficiary which will now empowered the Security
company to release the consignment (fund) to you.
Please I will appreciate your quick response weather you accept
this proposal or not to enable me to know the next step of action
and please you can as well use your name or your company name as

Please do not be apprehensive by this mail as I humbly seek YOUR PATIENCE,
UNDERSTANDING and COOPERATION in regard to my below plight. Once again, do
not
be apprehensive considering its magnitude and the fact that we have not
meet before.
I am contacting you in confidence believing that you will not turn down my
humble
request of you, which I intend for our mutual benefit.

I am Mr. Harrison Bello, an accountant with Fountain Trust Finance House. I
am
the account manager of Mr. Fredrick Coleman, an Australian, who used to be a
civil contractor in Nigeria. In 1999, Mr. Fredrick Coleman was involved in a
car accident along Sagamu express road and unfortunately his live. Since
then I
have made several enquiries through his country�s embassy to locate any
of his extended relatives without successful.

Hence, I am contacting you to assist in retrieving the money and property
left
behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by
this firm.Mr. Fredrick Coleman�s an account is valued 18.7 million dollars.
The
company has issued me a notice to provide his next of kin or have the
account
confiscated within the three months. Since I have been unsuccessful in
locating
his relatives for over 4 years now. I am therefore seeking your consent to
present you as the next of kin to the Mr. Coleman so that the proceeds of
this
account can be paid to you.

I intend to use part of this money for investment and charity outreach
while we
shall use part of it for our effort. For your assistance you will be
entitled
to 30% and I 65%. While 5% shall be used to reimburse expenses that might
be incurred
during the process. I have all necessary data to facilitate success.

All I require is your honest co-operation and support to enable us see this
deal through.
I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
will prevent any
breach of the law.

Please, if its okay with you, get back to me at this email
(hansob@netzero.com) to enable us
discuss further.

Best regards,
Harrison Bello.

 FROM: DIAKA TSHOMBE

 DEAR FRIEND,

 MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS
 LETTER MEETS YOU IN GOOD HEALTH. I AM DIAKA TSHOMBE,
 AIDE  TO THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF
 ZAIRE NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO
 (DRC).  I AM WRITING TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR
 PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN
 NIGERIA.

 I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN CONFIDENCE
 CONSIDERING MY PRSENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS
 A  WAR REFUGEE HERE IN NIGERIA. FEW WEEKS BEFORE
 THE LATE  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER,  I WAS  INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF
 US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND
 LODGED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING
 DISCLOSED AS FAMILY VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING
 FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16
 1997,  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE
 REBELS  LED BY LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM
 KISINGANI AND FLED TO TOGO FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED
 TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS
 THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER.
 HE  WAS AGED 66 YEARS. I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO NIGERIA WITH  MY SON PATRICE, AGED 17 WHERE I AM PRESENTLY  RESIDING AS A  WAR REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE CAPITAL CITY   KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST MY  WIFE  AND MY TWO CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING  THE  REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY.

 THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE
 AMASSED A PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH
 HOUSES  IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT
 PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE
 SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO
 FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES.
 I  THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE
 SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE NOW
 THAT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH
 KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER.

 I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY
 ABROAD  WHERE THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES.
 THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM
 KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
 INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY
 RECEIVING THE MONEY ON MY BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS
 MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU THE MODALITIES FOR
 THE  CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE
 THE  HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS
 DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND
 CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED IN YOU.

 IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE
 PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE
 CURRENTLY BEIGN MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER
 MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES.
 I  AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF
 THE  MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED.

 FOR THIS REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR CONTACT
 INFORMATION, WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND
 FAX  NUMBERS FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE
 RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS.

 YOURS SINCERELY,

 DIAKA TSHOMBE.

Hi,

This is Vasil Nanchev. I just wanted to inform you about something
which is really time sensitive. For the first time in �20 years,
America is going to witness the launch of a new nationwide
newspaper. �"THE USA TIMES" will �launch on �Jan. 1 2004, and
the
promotion is on now. You can join for free and bring other members
into the program to get a great residual income for life. They are
promoting it through MLM and paying on 5 levels. This is going to
get huge and people who act now will be earning a lot of money �in
the years to come.

Don't waste time and sign-up at
http://www.newsbucks.com/index.php?id=49641

As soon as you sign-up (for free), just contact me and I will tell
you how to get other people to join the program. If only 10 people
(which could be your friends, family members or co-workers)
sign-up
under you, you can make thousands of dollars every month without
doing any work. It's true!

I am really excited and I am sure you will be too after you read
the complete details.

Here is the link again ...

Dear Friend


You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me =
personally. I am the first daughter of the most popular black farmer in =
Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country.

 I got your contact through network online hence i decided to write you. =
Before the death of my father, he took me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum =
of US$30 Million (thirty million United States dollars), in one of the  =
security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money =
was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from the =
Security Company.

This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the =
Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came =
when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe,  introduced a new Land Act =
Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, =
and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans =
and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because =
of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. it is =
against this background that I and my family fled

Zimbabwe to South Africa for fear of our lives.

After which, I traveled to the Netherlands and I am currently staying in the =
Netherlands where i am seeking political asylum and more so have decided to =
transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the law =
of Europe prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to =
be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of =
European Union. As the eldest child of my father, I am saddled with the =
responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be =
transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking =
everything we have got.

The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced =
with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of my family name for =
fear of going through difficulty in future. Both countries have similar =
political history. I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future =
and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction =
is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do =
for me, is to make arrangements with the security company to clear the =
Consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as i =
have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the =
Netherlands from South Africa.

But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of =
ownership to the consignment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can =
choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account =
for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper =
profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you =
want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all =
kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction.

If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money =
while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in any of the country of =
your choice.  while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required =
in this transaction.
I await your immediate reply and God bless.

Best regards,
Hellen Shaka Zuma

NOTE:
ON YOUR INABILITY TO HANDLE THIS TRANSACTION RESPOND TO ME AND INFORM ME SO I =
CAN LOOK FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

FROM THE DESK OF
BARRISTER AKANDE FREDRICK
NIKK PLAZA 5th FLOOR FLAT 4
AWOLOWO WAY IKEJA LAGOS NIGERIA

Dear ,

I am Barrister AKANDE FREDRICK, a solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney
to Mr. Alfred, a national of your country, who used to work with Eagle Cement
in Nigeria. Here in after Eagle Cement be referred to as my client. On the
21st of April 2001, my client, his wife and their only daughter were involved
in a car accident along sagbama express road.All occupants of the vehicle
unfortunately lost there lives. Since then I have made several enquiries
to your embassy here to locate any of my clients extended relatives,

this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts,
I decided to track his last name over the Internet, to locate any member
of his family hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repartrating
the fund valued at US$13 million left behind by my client before it gets
Confisicated or declaredunserviceable by the Security Finance Firm where
this huge amount weredeposited. The said Security Finance company has issued
me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confisicated
within the next fourteen official working days. For the fact that I have
been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek
the consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased,since you
have the same last name with my client, so that the proceeds of this account
can be paid to you. Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we
shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer.

I have all necessary information and legal documents needed to back you
up for claim. All I require from you is your honest cooperation to enable
us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed
under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the
law.
Best Regards,
BARRISTER
AKANDE FREDRICK(Esq).
